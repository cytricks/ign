      IGN is awesome! IGN is my number one source for the latest game reviews and news. It’s warm and friendly attitude just resonates with me way more than any other video game related site I visit. Where else can we hear editor’s express their cold hard opinions on things in a very casual and none condescending way. IGN gives it to you straight up without holding anything back.

   IGN needs me because I am a very motivated worker. I love video game and anything video game related. I am a self motivator and love to learn fun and interesting things. I am only 20 and I have been through some very though struggles and know how to focus and push through even when it is a very difficult road. I was paralyzed from the waist down from a spine injury and underwent surgery and a lot of physical therapy. Even when doctors and PTs told me they didn’t thing I would walk again I pushed through the excruciating nerve pain and proved them wrong. I have had tough times in my past and I have a long live to live, if I am faced with a problem you can bet I will let nothing stop me. 
   
   I really would love to work for IGN! The biggest name for game news and reviews that keeps getting bigger! I listen to most of the IGN’s podcast, have the IGN website as my homepage so I always know the latest news and follow most of the IGN review staff on twitter. I know I would be working on the engineering side of the site but helping improve something so awesome would be a real honor. I love you guys and I am willing to do anything to be a part of the IGN family.
