      Hi my name is Ishmeal, I also go by Mike. I was born is Brooklyn, New York but I was raised on St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. I go to Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York. I travel a lot and I adapt to new environments easily. 
   I am double majoring in Software Engineering and Computer Science and minoring in Math at Clarkson. I am very knowledgeable of C++ and know basic JAVA and OPENGL and I have a very strong math background.  I am technically heading into my fourth year being there but academically it will be my third, as I suffered an injury that temporally had me paralyzed from the waist down and had to withdraw my freshmen year. I am a self motivated person and do not let anything get in my way. Even when doctors and PTs told me they didn’t think I would walk again I pushed through the excruciating nerve pain and proved them wrong. I have had tough times in my past and I have a long live to live, if I am faced with a problem you can bet I will let nothing stop me. 
   
   I do not have much work experience. I hope this would be a great stepping stone. I want to be a part of the game industry. I love games and am currently trying to make my own game. I promise if chosen I will not let you down. I will try my best and give nothing less than one-hundred percent. 
   
   What I hope to get out of this is an internship for the summer with me returning to school in the fall. I also hope to continue a strong relationship with IGN in hope of me returning next summer to continue the internship. I would then hope to work for IGN upon graduating and continuing my career with IGN as far as you would allow me to. 
      
      -Thank You for your time!
